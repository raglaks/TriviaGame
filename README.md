# TriviaGame

This was one of the intro jQuery assignments in my full-stack web development bootcamp. The main requirement was to build a trivia app that also utilized JavaScript timers.

After deciding on the theme—I went with Quentin Tarantino movie stills—the rest of the project went smoothly. The only real issue that I had was the size of the images being used. If you're on a slow internet connection, these images will take time to load as they weren't optimized beforehand. 

If I were to do this again, I would probably fix the image size issue and try to make the logic more dynamic. In other words, as it stands, adding a new question is a an annoying process. It would be much better if I simply generated a DOM function and plugged in the pictures and options in a bigger object, to generate new questions.
